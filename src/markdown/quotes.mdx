# Quotes project

## Why?
The reason why i created this project is because me and my friends say a lot of random / wierd stuff (very quirky i know). I thought it would be fun to store the quotes in some way and make them accessable / makeable in some way shape or form.

This project consists of multiple smaller applicatons that combine the whole project as a whole. I have made the **C#** Backend in Combination with a **MongoDB** Database, A **Nextjs** frontend and a **Python** discord bot.

## Backend

I started off with creating the backend of the project and setting up a MongoDB database. For the backend i used C# as stated before and i started making the REST API. This is the project structure that i set up and that i used for the project

```
quotes-backend/
├── DAL             # Data Access Layer
├── DTO             # Data Transfer Object(s)
├── Factory         # Providing the DAL
├── Interface
├── Logic
└── quotes-backend  # swagger UI
```

This REST API has a Swagger web interface built in that will adjust to my needs. I also can edit the the interface a bit so it looks like this:
<img src='/webapi.png' style={{width: "70%", height: "70%"}}/>

There are small descriptions per function on what it does.
