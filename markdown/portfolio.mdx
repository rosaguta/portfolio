# Portfolio.project

## The idea

The idea for this project is simple. I needed a website on where i can showcase my projects and write a small introduction about myself for recruiters or people who are interested on what im currently developing.

I didnt want to build a wall of text as a website. Those are plain and easy to make which isnt bad but i wanted to challenge myself with the knowledge that i currently have. I have at the time writing this page about 1 year of nextjs experience.

After a bit of brainstoming i settled down on the idea of making an Operating System  website branded around my name. Its not going to be a fully fledged operating system but it will look like one

## The sketches / design

I already had an design in mind so i started with *building* the design in figma:

<Figma height={`700`} url="file/5swI4weAXWIjffV6yqX2Hl/portfolio-ofzo?t=1hTjnSF25JjPZy13-0" title='Design'/>

The design i made in figma are just ideas that i had in my head and i didnt make them functional in figma itself. On this page you can view the different kind of *views* that you may come across upon opening this website. so you have the default view as the plain desktop for example or a view for when a user clicks on the network tab. The animation is also kinda written out on how it would look like.

When i was done designing this website and showcasing it to my friends, It was time to build the website.

## Building the site

A big part of this site is build using [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) (this library got recommended to me by a friend). This allows me to do the the intro animation that you see in the beginning but also the smaller animations like the socials and the browser.

### Intro animation
<div className='flex flex-col md:flex-row'>
    <video src='/intro.mp4' controls="play" className='h-40 md:h-96 object-scale-down' loop />
    <img src='https://www.codeproject.com/KB/Articles/839230/Image3-Qemu.gif'  className='h-40 md:h-96   object-scale-down' />
</div>
Fistly i started building the *startup* animation upon viewing this website. As you have noticed, a Linux styled animation plays when viewing this website. This intro animation is inspired by the raspberry pi startup (the 2nd video). The Idea of having the logo displayed on the startup inspired me to create my own startup animation which you can see on in the first video, or by just reloading the page. 

### The Desktop landing page

I wanted to make the website feel like an actual desktop so i created the desktop page as you view it now by minimizing this (built-in) browser. There isnt alot of excting stuff to view hence its a desktop. You can see the different *apps* on the page and the taskbar at the bottom with a few icons. these icons have a reference to my
