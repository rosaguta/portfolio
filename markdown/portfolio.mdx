# Portfolio.project

## The idea

The idea for this project is simple. I needed a website on where i can showcase my projects and write a small introduction about myself for recruiters or people who are interested on what im currently developing.

I didnt want to build a wall of text as a website. Those are plain and easy to make which isnt bad but i wanted to challenge myself with the knowledge that i currently have. I have at the time writing this page about 1 year of nextjs experience.

After a bit of brainstoming i settled down on the idea of making an Operating System  website branded around my name. Its not going to be a fully fledged operating system but it will look like one

## The sketches / design

I already had an design in mind so i started with *building* the design in figma:

<Figma height={`700`} url="file/5swI4weAXWIjffV6yqX2Hl/portfolio-ofzo?t=1hTjnSF25JjPZy13-0" title='Design'/>

The design i made in figma are just ideas that i had in my head and i didnt make them functional in figma itself. On this page you can view the different kind of *views* that you may come across upon opening this website. so you have the default view as the plain desktop for example or a view for when a user clicks on the network tab. The animation is also kinda written out on how it would look like.

When i was done designing this website and showcasing it to my friends, It was time to build the website.

## Building the site

### Intro animation

{/* <video controls="controls" height='400'>
    <source src="/intro.mp4"/>
</video> */}


Fistly i started building the *startup* animation upon viewing this website. As you have noticed, a Linux styled animation plays when viewing this website. A part of this site is build using [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) (this library got recommended to me by a friend). This allows me to do the the intro animation that you see in the beginning but also the smaller animations like the socials and the browser.
