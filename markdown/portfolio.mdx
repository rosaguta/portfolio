# Portfolio.project

## The idea

The goal of this project was straightforward: create a personal website where I can showcase my projects and give visitors a clear impression of who I am as a developer. The primary audience is recruiters and people who are interested in what I’m currently building or experimenting with.

Instead of creating a traditional portfolio filled with long paragraphs of text, I wanted to challenge myself to build something more interactive and visually engaging. At the time of writing this project, I had roughly one year of experience working with Next.js, and I wanted to push that knowledge further rather than taking the “safe” route.

After some brainstorming, I landed on the concept of an **operating-system–styled website**, branded around my name. It is not meant to be a fully functional operating system, but rather a website that *feels* like one complete with a desktop, applications, animations, and a taskbar.

## The sketches / design

Before writing any code, I translated the ideas in my head into a visual design using Figma:

<iframe
  style={{ width: '100%', height: '500px' }}
  loading="lazy"
  allowFullScreen
  src={`https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=mdx&url=https://www.figma.com/file/5swI4weAXWIjffV6yqX2Hl/portfolio-ofzo?t=1hTjnSF25JjPZy13-0`}
  title="Design"
/>

The designs created in Figma were not meant to be fully interactive prototypes, but rather a collection of visual ideas and layout concepts. They show the different *views* a user might encounter when navigating the website such as the default desktop view or specific application windows like the network panel.

Animations were also roughly sketched out to give a sense of how transitions and interactions should feel once implemented in code.

Once the general direction felt right and after sharing the concept with friends, it was time to start building the actual website.

## Building the site

A large part of the site is built using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), a library that was recommended to me by a friend. Framer Motion made it possible to implement both large-scale animations (such as the intro sequence) and smaller interaction details (like application transitions, social icons, and window animations).

### Intro animation

<div className='flex flex-col md:flex-row'>
  <video src='/intro.mp4' controls="play" className='h-40 md:h-96 object-scale-down' loop />
  <img src='https://www.codeproject.com/KB/Articles/839230/Image3-Qemu.gif' className='h-40 md:h-96 object-scale-down' />
</div>

The first thing I worked on was the *startup* animation that plays when the website loads. This animation is intentionally styled after a Linux boot sequence. The inspiration came from the Raspberry Pi startup animation (shown in the second visual above), where a logo is displayed during system initialization.

That idea motivated me to design a custom startup sequence for my own “OS-style” website. The result is the intro animation shown in the first video above, which can also be replayed by refreshing the page. This animation helps immediately set the tone of the website and reinforces the operating system concept from the first interaction.

### The desktop landing page

After the intro animation finishes, the website transitions into the desktop view. This view is designed to resemble an actual operating system desktop rather than a traditional webpage. The content you are currently reading is displayed inside a built-in browser window, which can be minimized to reveal the desktop underneath.

The desktop itself is intentionally minimal. It contains several “applications” represented as icons, along with a taskbar at the bottom of the screen. These elements are meant to feel familiar to users who are used to desktop operating systems, while still functioning as navigation elements within a web application.

Each icon and interaction on the desktop references a specific part of my portfolio, projects, or online presence, reinforcing the idea that the website itself is an interactive representation of how I think about software and user experience.



## Technical stack

This project is built using **Next.js** as the main framework. Next.js was chosen because it provides a solid balance between developer experience, performance, and flexibility. It allows me to structure the application in a clear, component-based way while still supporting modern routing and rendering patterns.

For animations and transitions, **Framer Motion** is used extensively throughout the project. Animations are not treated as decorative extras, but as a core part of the user experience. Window transitions, desktop interactions, and the startup sequence all rely on Framer Motion to remain smooth and predictable while still feeling responsive.

Styling is handled directly within the React component structure, keeping visual logic close to functional logic. This makes it easier to reason about UI state, animations, and layout changes together.

## Application structure

The application is structured around reusable UI components that represent familiar operating system concepts such as windows, desktop icons, and taskbar items. Each of these components encapsulates its own behavior, visual state, and animations.

Rather than navigating between traditional pages, most interactions happen within the same view. Application windows are mounted and unmounted dynamically, which reinforces the illusion of a desktop environment instead of a static website with page reloads.

State is handled locally where possible, keeping complexity low and avoiding unnecessary global state. This makes the behavior of each “application” window easier to reason about and modify independently.

---

## Animation and interaction logic

Animations are tightly coupled to user interaction and application state. For example:

* Startup animations play once on initial load and transition cleanly into the desktop view
* Windows animate in and out rather than appearing or disappearing instantly
* UI elements provide subtle feedback on hover and interaction

By relying on declarative animations instead of imperative timing logic, the code remains readable and maintainable while still allowing for complex motion sequences.

---

## Dockerization

The project includes a **Docker setup** to make the application easy to build and run in a consistent environment. The Docker configuration is designed for production use, allowing the Next.js application to be built and served without relying on a local Node.js setup.

This approach makes it easier to deploy the project to different environments and ensures that the application behaves consistently regardless of where it is running.
